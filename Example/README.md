# Process tutorial follow along

Within this directory are a bunch of jupyter notebooks that are designed to help you use this package. Each one 
represents a separate process, so you should follow them in order.

## 1_Constructing_weights
This tutorial will show you how to create weights for places over time when these places change via area weight or 
sub-unit population. As an extension, it will also show you how to fix problems that might occur from multiple changes
occurring to a region that you do not directly observe.
