    "When using lots of different data sets it is possible to end up with differing naming systems, for example using welsh\n",
    "names rather than english for places in Wales or just places changing their names over time. To fix this we need to \n",
    "create a place reference, which will allow any name for a given place to be linked back to a single standardised name \n",
    "for our system. This means that we can merge in lots of different data-sets but maintain cohesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be assuming we had data at a sub-unit level, and we want to create a link between our sub-units\n",
    "and units over the time period. This often makes working with data simpler, as whilst you can and indeed must for your\n",
    "base units provide a geographic id (GID), a number may not give you a good idea of where an error actually is placed\n",
    "in your shapefile.\n",
